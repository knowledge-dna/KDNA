### Added (Phase 1: Discussion vs Decision Benchmark)
- **decision_state domain** — 4-state classification system: UNRESOLVED, CONDITIONAL, INTENTIONAL_DEFERRAL, EXECUTABLE_DECISION
- **30-scenario benchmark** (`benchmarks/decision-state-benchmark.json`) — outcome-ready schema with predicted_judgment, recommended_action, actual_outcome fields
- **Eval runner** (`benchmarks/eval-decision-state.js`) — one-command reproducible no-KDNA / with-KDNA comparison
- **Benchmark report** (`benchmarks/decision-state-comparison-report.md`) — 96.7% state accuracy with KDNA (vs 90.0% without), zero false actionization errors
- **Eval runner script** (`benchmarks/eval-runner.sh`) — fully reproducible with raw output preservation
- **Website /benchmark page** — displays decision-state v2 results with state accuracy and false actionization cards

### Added (Phase 2: SDK and Framework Integration)
- **Python SDK MVP** (`python-sdk/`) — `pip install kdna` with `load_domain`, `format_context`, `classify_input`
- **Python custom agent example** (`python-sdk/examples/custom_agent.py`) — framework-agnostic KDNAAgent class
- **TypeScript SDK example** (`examples/typescript-agent/`) — type-safe custom agent with full KDNA integration

- **Architecture article** (`docs/agents-lack-judgment.md`) — "AI Agents Do Not Lack Tools. They Lack Judgment."
- **Case study** (`docs/case-study-meeting-decisions.md`) — "$40,000 meeting that wasn't a decision"

### Changed
- **README** — added benchmark link, SDK examples, architecture article, and case study references
- **TypeScript types** (`src/types.d.ts`) — re-exported loader functions (`loadDomain`, `formatContext`, `classifyInput`, `loadCorePatterns`) for clean SDK imports

### Added (Phase 4: Judgment Trace and Outcome Data Infrastructure)
- **Judgment Trace schema** (`specs/judgment-trace-schema.json`) — formal JSON schema for transparent judgment traces
- **Outcome Record schema** (`specs/outcome-record-schema.json`) — schema for long-term judgment-outcome tracking
- **CLI trace output** — `kdna demo --trace` outputs structured JSON trace conforming to schema
- **Runtime API trace** — `/v1/project` and `/v1/judge` responses now include `trace` field with triggered axioms/frameworks/self-checks
- **Registry evaluation history** — `domains.json` v0.4.1 with `evaluation_history` array per domain
- **Registry spec update** — documented `eval_score`, `test_count`, `quality_badge`, and `evaluation_history` fields
- **decision_state in registry** — added to registry with benchmark results (96.7% state accuracy, 30 scenarios)

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-18

### Added
