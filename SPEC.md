# KDNA Specification v1.0-rc

**Status:** Release Candidate  
**Previous:** v0.4 (superseded)  
**Editors:** KDNA Team  
**Repository:** https://github.com/knowledge-dna/kdna

## Abstract

KDNA (Knowledge DNA) is a structured format for encoding domain cognition for AI agents. This specification defines the file format, validation rules, loading behavior, and conformance requirements for KDNA domains.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- **Domain:** A specific area of expertise with recurring judgment patterns (e.g., sales, management, code review).
- **Domain Package:** A directory containing KDNA files conforming to this specification.
- **Loader:** Software that reads KDNA files and formats them for agent consumption.
- **Validator:** Software that checks KDNA files for structural compliance.
- **Registry:** A machine-readable index of available KDNA domains.

## 1. Scope

KDNA is designed for:
- AI agents that need stable domain judgment
- Domain experts packaging expertise for AI consumption
- Agent runtimes requiring structured context beyond raw documents
- Skill systems needing a cognition layer separate from execution steps

KDNA is NOT designed for:
- Storing large document collections
- Replacing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Replacing tool APIs or MCP servers
- Procedural automation steps
- Generic prompt collections

## 1.5. Boundaries and Extension

KDNA is a *judgment structure format*, not a general content format. The following boundaries are defined to prevent format dilution:

**Invariant (MUST NOT change across versions):**
- A domain is a directory containing at most 6 standard KDNA files
- Minimum valid domain = `KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json`
- Each file MUST contain a `meta` object with `version`, `domain`, `created`, `purpose`, `load_condition`
- Axioms MUST have `one_sentence`, `full_statement`, and `why`
- Misunderstandings MUST have `key_distinction`
- Self-checks MUST be answerable with yes/no
- Banned terms MUST have `why` and `replace_with`
- Reasoning chains MUST have `so_what`
- IDs MUST be unique within a domain
- Domain names and versions MUST be consistent across files

**Extension points (MAY be added by implementations):**
- Additional fields within existing objects (namespaced with `x_` prefix)
- Custom toolchain metadata in distribution containers
- Implementation-specific loading behaviors beyond the standard loader
- Additional validation rules beyond schema and lint

**Prohibited extensions (MUST NOT):**
- Adding new required KDNA files beyond the 6 standard files
- Removing or renaming standard fields
- Changing the semantics of existing fields
- Embedding executable code or workflow steps within KDNA files
- Using KDNA files as general-purpose configuration stores

## 1.6. Judgment Model

KDNA encodes domain judgment. This section defines what judgment consists of and how the 13 constituent elements map to KDNA file structures.

A **judgment** in KDNA is a domain-specific process that includes:

1. Classifying the current situation into a type the domain recognizes
2. Applying domain values, boundaries, and risk models
3. Weighing trade-offs between action paths
4. Selecting a response framework
5. Verifying the output against domain standards

### 1.6.1. Thirteen Judgment Components

The following table maps each component to its meaning and its location within a domain package:

| Component | Meaning | KDNA File | Field |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `worldview` | Default assumptions about how the world works in this domain | `KDNA_Core.json` | `worldview` (top level) |
| `values` | What matters more than what | `KDNA_Core.json` | `value_order`, `stances` |
| `purpose` | What this judgment serves | `meta` / `KDNA_Core.json` | `purpose`, `highest_question` |
| `role` | Who is judging and what they are responsible for | `KDNA_Core.json` | `judgment_role` |
| `knowledge` | Background knowledge that shapes judgment | `KDNA_Core.json` / `KDNA_Cases.json` | `ontology`, `cases` |
| `ontology` | How concepts are carved up and bounded | `KDNA_Core.json` | `ontology` |
| `classification` | Which situation type the current input belongs to | `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | `scenes[].trigger_signals` |
| `taste` | What counts as good vs. bad in this domain | `KDNA_Patterns.json` | `aesthetic_preferences` |
| `boundaries` | What must not be done | `KDNA_Patterns.json` | `boundaries`, `banned_terms` |
| `risk_model` | Which errors cost the most | `KDNA_Patterns.json` | `risk_model` |
| `context_signals` | When to trigger which judgment apparatus | `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | `trigger_signals`, `negative_signals` |
| `experience` | Historical cases and failure patterns | `KDNA_Cases.json` / `KDNA_Patterns.json` | `cases`, `counterexamples`, `misunderstandings` |
| `evaluation` | How to confirm judgment was valid | `evals/` directory / `KDNA_Evolution.json` | `eval_results`, `measurement` |

A domain author SHOULD populate all components that are relevant to the domain's judgment surface. A component MAY be omitted when the domain's judgment does not depend on it (e.g., a purely diagnostic domain may omit `taste`).

### 1.6.2. Boundary Statement

KDNA does not claim to exhaust human judgment. It provides a structured method for approximating repeatable judgment patterns: principles, concept distinctions, signals, boundaries, risks, cases, and evaluation. Some judgment remains implicit, situational, and the ultimate responsibility of the human operator.

## 2. Conformance Levels

Implementations MAY conform at one of three levels:

| Level | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| **Loader** | Reads and formats KDNA files for agent context |
| **Validator** | Loader + validates structural compliance |
| **Full** | Validator + supports all optional files + behavioral eval |

## 3. Domain Package

### 3.1 Directory

A domain package MUST be a directory. The directory name SHOULD use lowercase snake_case matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`.

A domain package SHOULD include a `kdna.json` manifest at the root. See Section 6.

### 3.2 Required Files

A conforming domain package MUST include:

| File | Responsibility | Load Condition |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| `KDNA_Core.json` | Axioms, ontology, frameworks, causal structure, stances | ALWAYS |
| `KDNA_Patterns.json` | Terminology, banned terms, misunderstandings, self-checks | ALWAYS |

A domain package that does not include both files MUST NOT be considered a valid KDNA domain.

### 3.3 Optional Files

A domain package MAY include any of the following:

| File | Responsibility | Load Condition |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | Scenario triggers and action orientation | Concrete situation detected |
| `KDNA_Cases.json` | Complete examples demonstrating structure | Examples or cases requested |
| `KDNA_Reasoning.json` | Reasoning chains and why explanations | Rationale or principles requested |
| `KDNA_Evolution.json` | Practice stages and measurable growth | Practice or measurement requested |

A domain package MUST NOT include more than 6 KDNA JSON files (excluding `kdna.json`).

#### 3.3.1 Optional File Semantics

Each optional file MAY be legitimately absent when the domain's judgment surface does not require it. To prevent consumer confusion between "does not need this file" and "has not written it yet," domain authors MAY document the reason for absence:

| File | Can Be Absent When |
|------|-------------------|
| `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | Domain judgment does not depend on situation-specific triggers. All axioms apply uniformly. |
| `KDNA_Cases.json` | Axioms are self-demonstrating without worked examples. The domain's concepts are simple enough that cases add no clarity. |
| `KDNA_Reasoning.json` | Axioms contain their own rationale (the `why` field is sufficient). No separate reasoning chains are needed. |
| `KDNA_Evolution.json` | Domain is designed as a static judgment reference, not a progressive skill path. No stage-based growth model exists. |

If a domain omits optional files, it SHOULD document the reason in its README. A domain reviewer or tool consumer who sees "2/6 files" MUST NOT assume incompleteness without reading the domain's rationale for omission.

#### 3.3.2 Three-Field System

Every domain package and registry entry MUST use a consistent three-field system to separate maturity, quality, and access:

| Field | Permitted Values | Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| `status` | `draft` \| `experimental` \| `stable` \| `deprecated` | Maturity of the domain's structure and content. `draft` = early work in progress; `experimental` = complete but not yet tested in practice; `stable` = structure frozen, content mature; `deprecated` = superseded by another domain. |
| `quality_badge` | `untested` \| `tested` \| `validated` \| `expert_reviewed` \| `production_ready` | Evidence level for the domain's judgment quality. `untested` = passes schema validation only; `tested` = has eval cases with manual verification; `validated` >= 10 eval cases with automated judgment scoring; `expert_reviewed` = externally reviewed by a domain expert; `production_ready` = validated + real-world deployment evidence. |
| `access` | `open` \| `licensed` \| `runtime` | How the domain is distributed. `open` = plaintext, freely available; `licensed` = encrypted, requires local license; `runtime` = not distributed, server-side API only. |

**Rules:**
- `status` and `quality_badge` are independent. A domain MAY be `stable` but `untested` (mature structure, no eval evidence), or `experimental` but `validated` (new domain with thorough testing).
- `quality_badge` SHOULD be stored in both the domain's `kdna.json` manifest AND the registry entry. Self-declared badges MUST be verifiable via `kdna verify --judgment`.
- `deprecated` domains MUST set `replaced_by` to the successor domain name.
- The old values `basic`, `pro`, and `reference` are retired. Previously `reference` domains SHOULD migrate to `status: stable` + `quality_badge: validated` or `expert_reviewed`.

**Minimum eval requirements by badge:**

| Badge | Minimum Eval Cases | Automated Scoring |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `untested` | 0 | N/A |
| `tested` | >= 3 | Manual verification |
| `validated` | >= 10 | `kdna verify --judgment` passes |
| `expert_reviewed` | >= 10 | External expert sign-off |
| `production_ready` | >= 10 | Deployment metrics + judgment improvement evidence |

### 3.4 Manifest

A domain package SHOULD include a `kdna.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "kdna_spec": "1.0-rc",
  "name": "<domain-id>",
  "version": "<semver>",
  "status": "draft | experimental | stable | deprecated",
  "quality_badge": "untested | tested | validated | expert_reviewed | production_ready",
  "access": "open | licensed | runtime",
  "language": "<ISO 639-1>",
  "author": { "name": "...", "id": "..." },
  "license": { "type": "...", "url": "..." },
  "description": "..."
}
```

## 4. Shared Root Structure

Every KDNA JSON file MUST include a `meta` object at the root with these REQUIRED fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Spec version this file conforms to (e.g., "0.4") |
| `domain` | string | Domain identifier matching the package name |
| `created` | string | ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `purpose` | string | One-sentence description of this file's role |
| `load_condition` | string | Human-readable condition for when to load this file |

The `domain` field MUST be identical across all files in a domain package.

## 5. Core File (`KDNA_Core.json`)

Each measurement MUST include `id`, `what`, `how`, and `threshold`. Measurements MUST describe observable behaviors.

## 8. Loading Behavior

### 8.1 Decision Tree

A conforming loader MUST follow this decision tree:

```
User message received
│
├─ ALWAYS load KDNA_Core.json + KDNA_Patterns.json
│
├─ Does input contain concrete situation/scene/case signals?
│   └─ Load KDNA_Scenarios.json
│
├─ Does input request examples or demonstrations?
│   └─ Load KDNA_Cases.json
│
├─ Does input ask why, rationale, or principles?
│   └─ Load KDNA_Reasoning.json
│
└─ Does input reference practice, growth, or measurement?
    └─ Load KDNA_Evolution.json
```

Multiple conditions MAY be true simultaneously.

### 8.2 Domain Selection

When multiple domains are available, the loader SHOULD:
1. Match user input keywords against domain `kdna.json` keywords
2. Prefer `stable` > `basic` > `experimental` status
3. Load one domain as leader, others as constraints
4. NOT load a domain if its boundary declaration conflicts with the task

### 8.3 Response Protocol

After loading KDNA, the agent SHOULD:
1. Internalize axioms as the domain frame
2. Use preferred terminology; avoid banned terms
3. Detect likely misunderstandings in user framing
4. Apply frameworks appropriate to the situation
5. Run self-check items before final output

The agent SHOULD NOT announce KDNA loading in normal responses. The agent MUST NOT expose full KDNA content to the user unless in debug mode.

## 9. Validation

### 9.1 Structural Validation

A conforming validator MUST check:

1. Required files exist (`KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json`)
2. Every JSON file has a `meta` object with all required fields
3. Required top-level fields exist in each file
4. All `id` fields are unique within the domain
5. Cross-file references resolve (e.g., `scene_id` in Cases references a Scene)
6. Every banned term has `why` and `replace_with`
7. Every misunderstanding has `key_distinction`
8. Every reasoning chain has `so_what`
9. Self-check items are yes/no answerable
10. No more than 6 KDNA JSON files per domain

A validator SHOULD also verify that the `domain` field in `meta` is consistent across all files.

### 9.2 Behavioral Validation

A conforming evaluator SHOULD test:
- Loaded vs. unloaded response quality difference
- Misunderstanding detection rate
- Terminology consistency (preferred terms used, banned terms avoided)
- Scenario trigger accuracy
- Self-check pass rate
- Axiom alignment in reasoning

The evaluation output MUST include a score and specific evidence for each dimension.

## 10. Compatibility

KDNA MAY be used with:
- Agent Skills (as a cognition layer loaded before task execution)
- MCP Resources (as structured context provided to tools)
- RAG systems (as a judgment lens for retrieved documents)
- Prompt routers (as domain-specific system prompts)
- Custom agent runtimes
- Local file-based assistants

KDNA MUST NOT replace these systems. It provides a cognition layer that operates alongside them.

## 11. Security Considerations

- KDNA files are JSON, not executable code. They MUST NOT contain active scripts.
- Domains using `licensed` or `runtime` access modes MUST be protected by the Runtime layer.
- The `kdna.json` manifest MUST NOT contain secrets or API keys.
- Loaders SHOULD validate JSON before parsing to prevent injection.

## 12. Version Compatibility

- KDNA v0.4 files are backward-compatible with v0.3 loaders for the Core+Patterns subset.
- Fields added in v0.4 (cluster support, quality thresholds) are OPTIONAL for v0.3.
- Loaders SHOULD ignore unknown fields to enable forward compatibility.

### 12.1 Domain Version Semantics

KDNA domains follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The `kdna.json` manifest `version` field and each file's `meta.version` MUST use semver.

| Level | Increment when | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **PATCH** (0.4.x) | Content refinement without structural change | Fix typo in axiom statement, clarify ontology boundary wording, improve self-check phrasing |
| **MINOR** (0.x.0) | New judgment structures added; no breaking changes to existing logic | Add new axiom, add ontology concept, add framework, add misunderstanding, add scenario |
| **MAJOR** (x.0.0) | Breaking changes to existing judgment logic | Remove axiom, change framework steps order, redefine concept boundary, change self-check trigger |

A domain at `v0.2.0` with only Core+Patterns is less mature than `v0.4.0` with Core+Patterns+Scenarios+Cases. The version number reflects structural evolution, not functional superiority. Two domains at different versions MAY both be valid for their respective scopes.

The SPEC version (`kdna_spec` in manifest) indicates which version of this specification the domain conforms to (e.g., `1.0-rc`). This is independent of the domain's own version number.
