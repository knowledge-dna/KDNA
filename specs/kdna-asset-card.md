# KDNA Asset Card Specification

Version: 0.1
Status: Draft
Canonical: `KDNA/specs/kdna-asset-card.md`

## 1. Purpose

A KDNA Asset Card is the discoverable, shareable, and evaluable representation of a KDNA domain judgment package. It serves the same role for KDNA assets that an app store listing serves for apps, a book cover serves for books, or a package page serves for npm/PyPI — but optimized for judgment assets.

Every KDNA domain, whether open or commercial, MUST have an Asset Card before it can be:
- Listed in the registry
- Installed by users
- Reviewed for quality badge promotion
- Offered as a commercial product

## 4. Asset Card vs Registry Entry

The Asset Card is a **superset** of the registry entry. Every field in the registry `domains.json` entry also appears in the Asset Card. The Asset Card adds:

- Creator profile and expertise context
- Audience definition (who should/shouldn't use)
- Judgment style description with sample inputs
- Subscription pricing and update cadence
- Support and refund policy
- Richer evidence summary with comparison report links

## 5. Required vs Recommended Fields

### Required for All Assets
- `asset_id`, `asset_version`, `asset_type`
- `creator.name`, `creator.id`
- `audience.who_should_use`, `audience.who_should_not_use`
- `judgment_style.summary`, `judgment_style.tone`, `judgment_style.strengths`, `judgment_style.limitations`, `judgment_style.sample_inputs`
- `license.type`, `license.commercial`, `license.allow_agent_use`
- `technical.spec_version`, `technical.languages`, `technical.default_language`, `technical.risk_level`, `technical.access_mode`, `technical.repo`
- `support.contact`

### Required for Commercial Assets (KCL-1.0 / licensed / runtime)
- All required fields above, plus:
- `creator.pubkey`
- `license.url`
- `subscription.model`, `subscription.price`, `subscription.includes_updates`
- `technical.signature`
- `evidence.quality_badge` (minimum: `tested`)
- `evidence.test_count` (minimum: 10)

### Required for quality_badge >= validated
- `evidence.benchmark_count` >= 1
- `evidence.comparison_report_url`
- `evidence.raw_outputs_url`
- `evidence.failure_cases_published` = true

## 6. Asset Card Generation

Asset Cards are generated from:
1. `kdna.json` manifest (technical, license, author fields)
2. `KDNA_Core.json` (axioms, ontology, frameworks for judgment style)
3. `KDNA_Evolution.json` (evaluation history)
4. Registry entry (quality_badge, test_count, asset_digest, signature)
5. Creator-supplied content (audience, sample inputs, support policy)

The Studio Creator flow will guide creators through completing all Asset Card fields.
The CLI `kdna publish` will validate Asset Card completeness before accepting a publication.

## 7. Validation Rules

A conforming Asset Card validator MUST enforce:

1. All required fields (by access mode and quality badge level) are present and non-empty.
2. `access_mode` is one of `open`, `licensed`, `runtime`.
3. For `licensed` or `runtime` assets, `license.url` points to the canonical KCL-1.0 URL.
4. `quality_badge` is one of `untested`, `tested`, `validated`, `expert_reviewed`, `production_ready`.
5. `sample_inputs` array has at least 2 entries, each with `scenario`, `without_kdna`, and `with_kdna`.
6. `audience.who_should_not_use` is not empty — every asset must declare its non-audience.
7. `judgment_style.tone` is one of the valid tone values.
8. For `production_ready` badge: `test_count` >= 30 and `benchmark_count` >= 2.
