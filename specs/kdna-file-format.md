# .kdna File Format Specification

Version: 0.4
Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose

`.kdna` is the portable container format for a valid KDNA domain. It wraps a
standard KDNA domain folder into a single distributable file, preserving the
original 6-file structure inside the container.

A `.kdna` file is **not** a merged single JSON or YAML document. It is a
**ZIP archive** whose contents are a standard KDNA domain folder.

## 2. Design Philosophy

```
Authoring        →  Studio project + dev source workspace (non-canonical)
Compile/export   →  Studio-compatible compiler emits .kdna with provenance
Distribution     →  .kdna container (ZIP archive, portable, signable)
Reading          →  Unpack internally, load per SPEC loading rules
Debugging        →  Unpack back to folder for inspection only
```

This is the same model as `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.epub`, `.vsix` — container files
that preserve internal structure rather than flattening it into one document.

## 3. File Extension

```
.kdna
```

Example: `writing.kdna`, `sketchnote-style.kdna`

Media type: `application/vnd.aikdna.kdna+zip`

## 4. Container Format

A `.kdna` file is a **ZIP archive** (DEFLATE compression, standard ZIP format).

Encoding of all files within the archive MUST be UTF-8.

## 5. Container Contents

A valid `.kdna` container MUST contain:

| File | Required | Purpose |
|------|:---:|---------|
| `mimetype` | ✅ | Fixed media marker: `application/vnd.aikdna.kdna+zip` |
| `KDNA_Core.json` | ✅ | Axioms, ontology, frameworks, causal structure, stances |
| `KDNA_Patterns.json` | ✅ | Terminology, banned terms, misunderstandings, self-checks |
| `kdna.json` | ✅ | Domain manifest (name, version, author, license, keywords) |

A valid `.kdna` container MAY contain:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | Scenario triggers and action orientation |
| `KDNA_Cases.json` | Concrete cases showing reasoning structure |
| `KDNA_Reasoning.json` | Reasoning chains: conclusion → logic → so_what |
| `KDNA_Evolution.json` | Capability stages, measurable indicators |
| `README.md` | Human-readable domain description |
| `LICENSE` | License file |

The container MUST NOT contain more than 6 KDNA JSON files (excluding `kdna.json`).

All files MUST be at the root of the archive (no nested directories).

## 6. Container Metadata

Metadata is read from `kdna.json` within the container. The container itself
does not have a separate metadata header — it is transparent ZIP.

## 7. Lifecycle Commands

```
create    →  KDNA Studio / kdna studio scaffold   Studio-compatible authoring
validate  →  kdna dev validate <folder>           Check dev source structure
bundle    →  kdna dev pack <folder>               Dev-only non-trusted bundle
inspect   →  kdna inspect <file.kdna>   Read container metadata + stats
unpack    →  kdna dev unpack <file.kdna>    .kdna → folder (debugging only)
install   →  kdna install <file.kdna>   Install container to local registry
```

### 7.1 `kdna dev pack`

Creates a dev-only `.kdna` bundle from a valid source folder. This command does
not create a trusted KDNA asset. To create a canonical trusted `.kdna`, use a
Studio-compatible compile/export pipeline.

The command:

1. Validates the folder has required files (`KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json`)
2. Ensures `kdna.json` manifest exists (generates one if missing)
3. Creates a ZIP archive containing all KDNA JSON files + `kdna.json` + `README.md` (if present) + `LICENSE` (if present)
4. Outputs `<name>.kdna` in the current directory

```bash
kdna dev pack ./sketchnote-style
# → sketchnote-style.kdna
```

### 7.2 `kdna dev unpack`

Extracts a `.kdna` container back to a standard domain folder for debugging and
inspection. Manual unpack/edit/repack invalidates trust.

```bash
kdna dev unpack sketchnote-style.kdna
# → sketchnote-style/
#     KDNA_Core.json
#     KDNA_Patterns.json
#     ...
```

If the target directory already exists, the command SHALL error unless `--force` is passed.

### 7.3 `kdna inspect`

Reads a `.kdna` container and displays its metadata and content summary.

```bash
kdna inspect sketchnote-style.kdna
# → Domain: sketchnote-style
# → Version: 0.1.0
# → Axioms: 4
# → Files: 6/6
# → ...
```

The command SHALL unpack the container to a temporary directory, read all files,
display the summary, and clean up.

## 8. Reading by Agents

Agents SHOULD NOT read the entire container at once. They SHOULD follow the
standard KDNA loading rules:

| Always load | `KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json` |
| On scenario detection | `KDNA_Scenarios.json` |
| On case/example request | `KDNA_Cases.json` |
| On "why" / rationale request | `KDNA_Reasoning.json` |
| On practice / measurement request | `KDNA_Evolution.json` |

## 9. Container Integrity

A `.kdna` container MAY include a checksum file (`checksum.sha256`) at the root.
Implementations MAY verify this checksum before loading.

A `.kdna` container MAY be digitally signed. Signature metadata (if present)
SHALL be stored in `kdna.json` under a `signature` field, not as a separate file.

## 10. Rejected Pre-v1.0 Merged Single-File

KDNA v0.1–v0.3 used a merged JSON/YAML single-file format where all 6 files
were concatenated into one document. This approach is not part of KDNA v1.0 for
the following reasons:

- Complex domains produce files over 500 lines — unreadable for humans
- Merged files cannot be incrementally edited or diffed per-section
- Merged files lose the standard 6-file structure that validators expect
- ZIP containers preserve the standard structure, enable per-file loading,
  and are the same model used by `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.epub`

The `kdna export` command from v0.1–v0.3 is outside the v1.0 protocol.

## 11. Version Policy

- `.kdna` containers are ZIP archives with root `mimetype` and `kdna.json`.
- Pre-v1.0 merged single-file `.kdna` files MUST NOT be accepted by conforming
  v1.0 tools.
