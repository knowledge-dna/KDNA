# .kdna File Format Specification

Version: 0.2
Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose

`.kdna` is the single-file human-readable format for a KDNA domain cognition asset.
It bundles all required and optional KDNA sections into one self-contained file
that can be read by both humans and AI agent loaders.

## 2. File Extension

```
.kdna
```

Example: `writing-basic.kdna`, `sales-pro.kdna`

## 3. Format

`.kdna` files use **subset of YAML 1.2** (preferred) or **JSON**. YAML is recommended
because it is more human-readable and supports multi-line strings naturally.

The file MUST be valid YAML 1.2 or valid JSON. Mixed formats are not allowed.

Encoding MUST be UTF-8.

## 4. Top-Level Structure

kdna_spec: "0.2"

## 12. Minimal Valid Example

```yaml

license:
  type: "CC-BY-4.0"
  url: "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  allow_agent_use: true
  allow_training: false

core:
  axioms:
    - id: "AX-001"
      one_sentence: "Clarity is the writer's only obligation."
      full_statement: "Every sentence must move the reader's understanding forward. If it does not, cut it."
      why: "Without this priority, writing becomes self-expression instead of communication."
  ontology:
    - id: "reader_model"
      one_sentence: "The imagined reader the writer is addressing."
      essence: "A specific person with specific knowledge, concerns, and attention span."
      boundary: "Not a generic 'audience' or 'everyone'."
      trigger_signal: "Writer uses 'we all know' or references unclear context."
  frameworks:
    - id: "FW-001"
      name: "Inversion Check"
      when_to_use: "When a sentence feels unclear."
      steps:
        - "Identify the sentence."
        - "Ask: what if the reader believes the opposite?"
        - "If confusion is possible, rewrite until unambiguous."
  core_structure:
    - from: "Vague idea"
      to: "Reader understanding"
      via: "Specific, testable sentences"
  stances:
    - id: "ST-001"
      stance: "Writing exists to transfer understanding, not to impress."
      anti_stance: "Writing exists to showcase vocabulary or intelligence."

patterns:
  terminology:
    preferred_terms:
      - term: "reader"
        definition: "The specific person who will consume this text."
    banned_terms:
      - term: "obviously"
        why: "If something is obvious, stating it insults the reader. If it is not obvious, stating this is dishonest."
        replace_with: "Remove the word and let the facts speak."
  misunderstandings:
    - id: "MS-001"
      wrong: "Good writing requires complex vocabulary."
      correct: "Good writing uses the simplest word that carries the precise meaning."
      key_distinction: "Complexity of vocabulary vs. precision of vocabulary."
      why: "Prioritizing complexity over precision produces writing that is impressive but unclear."
  self_check:
    - id: "SC-001"
      question: "Can each sentence be clearly understood by the intended reader?"
```

## 13. Relationship to .kdnapack

- `.kdna` is a single-file, human-readable format suitable for open-source and public sharing.
- `.kdnapack` is a multi-file package format suitable for complex domains with many cases,
  scenarios, or localized content. See `kdna-package-format.md`.

A `.kdna` file can be converted to a `.kdnapack` directory using `kdna unpack`.
A `.kdnapack` directory can be converted to a `.kdna` file using `kdna pack --single`.

## 14. Extension Registration

The `.kdna` file extension SHOULD be registered as:

- **MIME type:** `application/x-kdna` (provisional), `application/kdna+yaml` (preferred)
- **File type:** text, UTF-8, YAML or JSON
- **Magic bytes (YAML):** starts with `kdna_spec:` at byte 0
- **Magic bytes (JSON):** starts with `{"kdna_spec":` at byte 0 (after optional whitespace)
