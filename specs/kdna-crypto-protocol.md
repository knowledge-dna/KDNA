# KDNA Crypto Protocol v0.1

## Status: CLI/Core MVP implemented for licensed encrypted entries; runtime watermarking remains a server-side design.

This document defines how .kdna files are encrypted, signed, licensed, and verified — the cryptographic infrastructure for KDNA as a tradeable judgment asset.

**Design principle:** KDNA encryption does not promise "uncopyable files." It promises legitimate purchase, authorized use, leak tracing, and managed revocation. The goal is to raise the cost of unauthorized use high enough to make honest purchase the rational choice.

---

## 1. Access Modes

Every KDNA domain declares one of three access modes. The mode determines the cryptographic treatment.

| Mode | Distribution | At Rest | At Load | Revocable | Watermark |
|------|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| `open` | Plaintext .kdna | Plaintext | Direct read | No | Optional |
| `licensed` | Licensed .kdna | Encrypted entries | Local in-memory decrypt with license key | Yes | Required |
| `runtime` | Never distributed | Server-side only | API projection | Yes | Required |

**Open mode** requires no cryptography. This document focuses on `licensed` and `runtime`.

---

## 2. Key Architecture

KDNA uses a single asset model with encrypted internal entries. The `.kdna`
container remains the canonical asset. The container is never password-protected
as a whole.

```
licensed .kdna asset
    ↓
  encrypted KDNA entries (AES-256-GCM envelopes)
    ↓
  entry decrypt key derived from license_key + machine_fingerprint
    ↓
  local activation metadata outside the asset
```

### 2.1 Entry Decrypt Key

- **Type:** 256-bit symmetric key derived with `scrypt-sha256`.
- **Inputs:** `license_key`, `machine_fingerprint`, and the encrypted-entry
  profile salt.
- **Scope:** Used only to decrypt protected entries in memory.
- **Persistence:** MUST NOT be written to disk, logged, or embedded in traces.

### 2.2 License Key

- **Format:** `KDNA-LIC-...` opaque activation key.
- **Purpose:** Proves the buyer can activate the asset and derives the local
  decrypt hook for `kdna-licensed-entry-v1`.
- **Storage:** MAY be present in the local activation file when required for
  offline licensed loading, but MUST NOT be printed, logged, included in audit
  events, or embedded in `.kdna` assets.

### 2.3 Registry and Author Signing Keys

- **Type:** Ed25519.
- **Purpose:** Sign published asset metadata and verify registry trust
  metadata.
- **Trust source:** Registry entries include digest and signature fields. The
  `.kdna` file is the signed object; extracted files are not a trust source.

---

## 3. Publishing Flow (Author → Registry)

```
Author creates source workspace
    ↓
kdna publish --access licensed --output ./dist/domain.kdna
    ↓
1. Publisher validates source workspace
2. Publisher encrypts protected KDNA entries as `kdna-licensed-entry-v1`
3. Publisher writes plaintext `kdna.json` manifest for discovery
4. Publisher computes asset digest over the `.kdna` file
5. Publisher computes canonical content digest over internal entries
6. Publisher signs published metadata with the author identity
    ↓
Asset published to registry:
  silver-care.kdna
  ├── kdna.json              (plaintext manifest, signed)
  ├── KDNA_Core.json         (encrypted-entry envelope)
  ├── KDNA_Patterns.json     (encrypted-entry envelope)
  └── KDNA_CARD.json         (optional plaintext public card)
```

### 3.1 Package Manifest

```json
{
  "kdna_spec": "1.0-rc",
  "format_version": "1.0",
  "domain": "silver-care",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "access": "licensed",
  "content_digest": "sha256:abc123...",
  "encryption": {
    "profile": "kdna-licensed-entry-v1",
    "encrypted_entries": [
      "KDNA_Core.json",
      "KDNA_Patterns.json"
    ]
  },
  "signature": "ed25519:def456..."
}
```

---

## 4. Purchase Flow (Buyer → Registry → Local)

```
Buyer installs and activates:
  kdna install @scope/silver-care
  kdna license activate @scope/silver-care --key KDNA-LIC-... --server <activate-url>
    ↓
1. CLI installs immutable `.kdna` under ~/.kdna/packages/
2. CLI sends activation request to entitlement server:
   {
     "domain": "@scope/silver-care",
     "license_key": "KDNA-LIC-...",
     "machine_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
     "client": "kdna-cli"
   }
    ↓
3. Server validates purchase, status, expiration, limits, and binding policy
4. Server returns activation object
    ↓
5. CLI stores local activation metadata outside the asset:
   {
     "license_id": "lic_abc123",
     "license_key": "KDNA-LIC-...",
     "domain": "@scope/silver-care",
     "status": "active",
     "machine_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
     "offline_valid_until": "2026-06-03T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
```

The production request/response contract is defined in
`kdna-entitlement-api.md`.

---

## 5. Load Flow (Runtime Decryption)

```
Agent triggers: kdna load @scope/silver-care
    ↓
1. Runtime resolves installed asset from ~/.kdna/index.json
2. Runtime reads the `.kdna` file directly
3. Runtime checks local activation: not expired, not revoked, domain matches,
   machine binding matches, and offline grace is valid
4. Runtime derives decrypt hook from license_key + machine_fingerprint
5. Runtime decrypts protected entries in memory only
6. Runtime loads the requested profile into agent context
7. Runtime logs audit metadata without license_key or decrypted content
    ↓
Plaintext KDNA NEVER touches disk.
```

---

## 6. Revocation Flow

```
Entitlement server revokes buyer's license
    ↓
Server updates license status → revoked
kdna CLI periodically syncs (kdna license sync)
    ↓
Next load attempt:
  License status: revoked
  Runtime refuses to decrypt
  Audit log records revocation check
```

Offline grace period is declared by the activation response. After grace expires
without a successful sync, license loading fails closed until the next successful
sync.

---

## 7. Watermark Policy

Watermarking is an accountability layer above local decryption. Runtime KDNA
SHOULD include server-side watermark traces. Licensed local KDNA MAY include
watermark policy in the asset or entitlement response, but watermarking is not
required for the CLI/Core encrypted-entry MVP.

| Mode | Watermark Content | Injection Point |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| `licensed` | buyer_id + license_id + timestamp | Encoded in response text (zero-width marker) |
| `runtime` | buyer_id + call_id + timestamp | Encoded in API response |

If a watermarked response appears publicly, Registry can:
1. Extract watermark → identify buyer
2. Issue warning
3. Revoke license if repeated

This is NOT DRM. It is **leak accountability**: the buyer knows their identity
or license identifier may be traceable in authorized projections or responses.

---

## 8. Licensed .kdna Format

The licensed `.kdna` file keeps the single asset extension. Protected entries are JSON envelopes encrypted under `kdna-licensed-entry-v1`:

```
silver-care-1.0.0.kdna
├── kdna.json              (manifest)
├── KDNA_Core.json         (encrypted-entry envelope)
├── KDNA_Patterns.json     (encrypted-entry envelope)
├── watermark.profile.json  (watermark configuration)
└── signature.json          (detached signatures)
```

The `.kdna` asset is a ZIP container. Publishers SHOULD use stable entry order
and metadata normalization when reproducible builds are required, but the signed
asset digest remains the source of truth.

---

## 9. Publisher Identity Key Management

### 9.1 Key Generation

```bash
kdna identity init
```

Generates:
- `~/.kdna/identity/kdna.key` — Ed25519 private key (PEM, chmod 600)
- `~/.kdna/identity/kdna.pub` — Ed25519 public key (PEM)

This identity signs published asset metadata. It is not the buyer license secret
used for local decryption.

### 9.2 Key Backup

```bash
kdna identity export --output kdna-identity-backup.age
```

Encrypts the private key with a user-provided passphrase (age encryption).

### 9.3 Key Rotation

```bash
kdna identity rotate
```

Generates a new publisher key pair. Existing published assets remain signed by
the old key and continue to verify through registry trust metadata until the
registry rotates or revokes that key.

---

## 10. Security Assumptions

1. **Registry trust metadata is trusted** — a compromised registry signing key can publish malicious metadata. Mitigation: threshold signing and key rotation in the trust layer.
2. **License keys are bearer secrets** — if leaked, a license may be abused until revoked or re-bound. Mitigation: machine binding, short offline leases, sync, and audit.
3. **Plaintext exists in agent context** — any agent that uses local licensed KDNA can receive plaintext fragments in context. This is unavoidable. The defense is activation, projection, audit, and licensing, not absolute prevention.
4. **Offline use is policy-controlled** — `licensed` mode works offline only until `offline_valid_until`. This is a business decision, not a crypto limitation.

## 11. What This Protocol Does NOT Promise

- ❌ "No one can ever see the plaintext"
- ❌ "Copy-proof files"
- ❌ "Unbreakable encryption"
- ❌ "Replaces legal agreements"

What it DOES provide:
- ✅ Legitimate purchase mechanism with cryptographic proof
- ✅ Tamper-evident packages (signature verification)
- ✅ Leak accountability when runtime watermarking is enabled
- ✅ Managed revocation through entitlement sync
- ✅ Clear separation of open / licensed / runtime modes
- ✅ License keys excluded from audit logs and traces
