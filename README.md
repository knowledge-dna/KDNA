**KDNA is an open protocol for packaging domain judgment into loadable, testable, governable assets for AI agents.**

Prompts tell AI what to say. Skills tell AI what to do. MCP connects AI to tools.  
**KDNA tells AI how to judge within a domain.**

AI agents have tools, workflows, and knowledge bases. What they lack is transferable judgment — the ability to evaluate a situation the way an expert would, not the way a general-purpose model would. KDNA encodes that judgment in a machine-verifiable, human-inspectable format.

Self-improving agents need judgment governance. Without explicit judgment, improvement becomes drift. KDNA is the protocol for human-governed self-improvement: agents can learn from work, but judgment updates require Human Judgment Lock.

## 30-second example

Same model. Same input. Different judgment path.

```
User: "Help me improve this product launch post."

Without KDNA:
  → Suggests clearer wording, shorter sentences, more enthusiasm.

With writing.kdna:
  → Classifies as structural writing diagnosis (not language polishing).
  → Checks: Is there a real argument? A cognitive hook? Evidence density?
  → Avoids banned terms: "polish the language", "make it punchy".
  → Self-checks: 5/5 passed. Risk flags: none.
```

The agent didn't get better at writing. It got better at *judging what kind of problem this is*.

## Quick start

```bash
npm i -g @aikdna/kdna
kdna setup
kdna install writing
kdna compare @aikdna/writing --input "help me improve this post"
```

- `kdna setup` — Installs the kdna-loader skill into your agent (OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini).
- `kdna install <name>` — Downloads a domain from the registry. Writing, code review, decision state, and 6 others are available.
- `kdna compare` — Sends the same input to an LLM with and without KDNA, diffing the judgment paths.
- `kdna verify @aikdna/writing --judgment` — Scores governance coverage, eval pass rate, and structural integrity.

```bash
# Create your own domain
kdna init my_expertise
# ... fill in KDNA_Core.json and KDNA_Patterns.json ...
kdna validate my_expertise
kdna publish --check my_expertise
kdna publish my_expertise
```

## How KDNA fits in the AI agent stack

| Mechanism | What it provides | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Prompt** | What to say | "You are a helpful assistant." |
| **Skill / Workflow** | What steps to follow | "Run lint, then format, then commit." |
| **MCP / API** | What tools to call | "Call the GitHub API to create a PR." |
| **RAG / Knowledge base** | What facts to retrieve | "Here are the company's coding standards." |
| **Fine-tuning** | What behavior to internalize | Model trained on expert decisions. |
| **KDNA** | **How to judge within a domain** | "Classify whether this is a structural problem or a language problem. Apply axioms X and Y. Avoid banned term Z. Run self-checks." |

KDNA does not replace these mechanisms. It provides a cognition layer that operates alongside them. For a deeper comparison, see [Where KDNA fits](https://aikdna.com/docs/positioning).
