# KDNA v1.0-rc Standard Kit

KDNA v1.0-rc is the asset-first release candidate for the open judgment asset
layer. The goal of this kit is to give implementers one canonical entry point
instead of forcing them to infer the standard from scattered repository files.

## Normative Implementation Rules

1. `.kdna` is the canonical user-facing cognition asset.
2. Source directories are dev-only authoring workspaces.
3. Installed assets are stored as immutable packages, not persistent unpacked
   domain directories.
4. Loaders must read `.kdna` directly or use hidden, rebuildable caches.
5. Installers must enforce `asset_digest`, yanked state, and revocation state.
6. Trust-aware runtimes must verify signatures against registry scope keys.
7. Licensed encrypted entries must be decrypted in memory.
8. Composition must preserve attribution and surface conflicts.
9. Quality badges must follow the official badge names and evidence thresholds.
10. KDNA-compatible claims must pass the relevant conformance profile.

## Implementer Path

1. Build an asset reader that opens `.kdna` without persistent extraction.
2. Implement inspect, validate, load, render, digest verification, and optional
   signature verification.
3. Run `npm run certify:asset-loader` or the matching profile command.
4. Publish a compatibility report and known deviations.
5. Request certification through the governance process if official marks are
   needed.

## Current Release-Candidate Boundary

This kit defines the open protocol and compatibility surface. It does not claim
that every official domain is validated or production-ready. Domain quality is
governed separately by the registry badge evidence gates.
