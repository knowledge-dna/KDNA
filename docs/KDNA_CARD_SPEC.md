# KDNA Card Specification

Every KDNA domain SHOULD publish a KDNA Card — a standardized metadata document describing the domain's purpose, risks, provenance, and governance status.

## Purpose

The KDNA Card serves the same role as a model card in machine learning: it helps deployers make responsible decisions about whether and how to use a KDNA domain.

## Format

```json
{
  "name": "@aikdna/leadership_decisions",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "risk_level": "R1",
  "intended_use": [
    "Diagnosing team execution failures",
    "Evaluating whether a meeting produced a real decision",
    "Assessing decision speed vs decision quality trade-offs"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Hiring and termination decisions",
    "Legal compliance assessment",
    "Individual performance evaluation"
  ],
  "known_limitations": [
    "This domain was developed from leadership coaching experience with teams of 5-50 people. It has not been tested in very large organizations or military contexts.",
    "The domain assumes a baseline of organizational stability. It may not apply during crisis or rapid restructuring."
  ],
  "author_responsibility": "The encoded judgment represents 15 years of leadership coaching across 200+ teams. The author takes responsibility for the judgment patterns encoded in this domain.",
  "risk_warnings": [
    "This domain may not apply to safety-critical leadership decisions",
    "The 'speed over perfection' axiom should NOT be applied to irreversible resource commitments"
  ],
  "human_lock_summary": {
    "locked_cards": 10,
    "locked_axioms": 3,
    "locked_misunderstandings": 2,
    "locked_self_checks": 5,
    "feynman_restatements": 5,

| `name` | Always | Domain name |
| `version` | Always | Domain version |
| `risk_level` | Always | R0/R1/R2/R3 |
| `intended_use` | Always | What this domain is designed for |
| `out_of_scope` | Always | What this domain explicitly does NOT cover |

## Generation

KDNA Studio Core generates a `KDNA_CARD.json` as part of the compile output when `governance` metadata is present on the project. The card is included in the `.kdna` container.
