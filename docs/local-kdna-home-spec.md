# ~/.kdna Directory Specification v1.0

> **Status:** Draft · 2026-05-26
> **Applies to:** kdna-cli, KDNAChat, KDNAStudio

## Purpose

Define the canonical local directory structure for all KDNA products. Every product MUST use `~/.kdna/` as its local KDNA home. Products that store KDNA data elsewhere break ecosystem interoperability.

KDNA's canonical installed object is a `.kdna` asset. Products MUST NOT treat extracted domain directories as installed runtime domains.

## Directory Structure

## Invariants

- `packages/` contains the real installed assets.
- `index.json` records installed asset names, versions, local asset paths, and receipt paths.
- `receipt.json` records install source, `asset_digest`, `content_digest`, signature status, access mode, install time, and local asset path.
- `registry/domains.json` records registry v3 trust metadata, including snapshot expiry, timestamp expiry, and revocations.
- `cache/` MAY contain temporary extracted files, but cache contents are not canonical and may be deleted.
- `domains/` is not part of the runtime model.
- Installers MUST NOT rewrite `kdna.json` inside an installed `.kdna` asset.

## Product Responsibilities

| Product | Reads from | Writes to |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| kdna-cli | `packages/`, `index.json`, `registry/` | `packages/`, `index.json`, `identity/`, `licenses/` |
| KDNAChat | `packages/`, `index.json`, `config.json` | `traces/`, `feedback/` |
| KDNAStudio | dev source workspaces, `identity/` | `.kdna` assets, `identity/` |

## Install Layout

Installing `@aikdna/writing@0.7.2` MUST produce:

```
~/.kdna/packages/@aikdna/writing/0.7.2/writing-0.7.2.kdna
~/.kdna/packages/@aikdna/writing/0.7.2/receipt.json
~/.kdna/index.json
```

It MUST NOT produce:

```
~/.kdna/domains/@aikdna/writing/KDNA_Core.json
~/.kdna/domains/@aikdna/writing/KDNA_Patterns.json
```

## Loading

A conforming runtime loads from the `.kdna` asset path recorded in `index.json` and verified by `receipt.json`. If a registry entry exists, the runtime or verifier MUST also reject yanked or revoked assets. It may read ZIP entries directly or extract to a hidden temporary directory for the duration of a command. Persistent extraction is not required and MUST NOT become the source of trust.
