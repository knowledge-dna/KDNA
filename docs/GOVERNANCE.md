# KDNA Governance & Safety Framework

KDNA is an open standard for human-locked domain judgment assets. Because KDNA can influence AI agent judgment, the ecosystem is designed around human accountability, provenance, risk-based review, quality gates, and transparent loading.

This framework is not a disclaimer — it is the constitutional layer of the KDNA ecosystem.

## 1. Human Accountability

**AI may propose judgment candidates. Humans must review, revise, lock, and take authorship responsibility.**

AI 可以提出判断候选，人必须审查、修改、锁定，并对发布的判断承担作者责任。

Every KDNA domain published to the registry carries the author's explicit confirmation via Human Lock. The author, not the AI, is accountable for the encoded judgment.

## 2. No One-Click Domain Generation

KDNA Studio and all compliant authoring tools MUST NOT offer automated domain generation that bypasses human review.

A valid KDNA domain requires:
- Evidence collection
- Structured interview or expert extraction
- Judgment Card authoring
- Human Lock on every card
- Feynman Restatement
- Quality Gate evaluation
- Test Lab verification
- Versioned release

These are governance mechanisms, not optional product features.

## 3. Intended Use & Out-of-Scope Declaration

Every KDNA domain MUST declare:
- **Intended use**: What situations the domain is designed for
- **Out-of-scope**: What situations the domain explicitly does NOT cover
- **Risk boundaries**: Known failure modes where application would be dangerous
- **High-risk domain restrictions**: If applicable, explicit warnings
- **Known limitations**: What the domain cannot do or was not tested for
- **Author responsibility**: Who stands behind the encoded judgment

## 4. Risk-Based Review (R0–R3)

| Level | Risk | Examples | Requirements |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| **R0** | Low | Writing, note-taking, content structure, personal productivity | Human Lock + validate |
| **R1** | Medium | Career development, management, education, business communication, sales | R0 + Feynman + Test Lab + known_limitations |
| **R2** | High | Relationships, mental well-being, enterprise compliance, financial decisions | R1 + expert_review + stronger_warnings + evidence_coverage |
| **R3** | Restricted | Medical diagnosis, legal judgment, investment advice, child safety, public safety, weapons, surveillance, political manipulation | Default: not allowed in public registry without special review |

## 5. Provenance & Signature

Every .kdna container MUST carry:
- Author identity
- Studio Core version used
- Source evidence references
- Locked card count
- Content fingerprint (sha256)
- Build timestamp
- Signature (Ed25519, scope-trusted)
- Registry source (if applicable)

Provenance establishes trust. Without it, .kdna is just an anonymous blob.

## 6. Runtime Transparency

When an agent loads a KDNA domain, the loading system SHOULD record:
- Which domain was loaded and at what version
- The domain's risk level and quality badge
- Whether the domain is signed and from a trusted scope
- Which axioms, misunderstandings, and self-checks were triggered
- Whether the domain was yanked or deprecated

This enables audit, debugging, and accountability.

## 7. Registry Moderation

The canonical KDNA registry classifies domains by review status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Unlisted** | Installable but not displayed in default listings |
| **Community** | Community-submitted, basic validation passed |
| **Verified** | Signature, provenance, quality gate passed |
| **Reviewed** | Human review completed |
| **Trusted** | Long-term maintenance, stable version history, no complaints |
| **Restricted** | High-risk, private registry or special review only |
| **Deprecated** | Superseded by replacement |
| **Yanked** | Severe risk — blocked from new installations |

### Official Quality Badges

Official KDNA quality badges (`tested`, `untested`, `unreleased`) are issued only by the official registry or authorized registries. Forked tools may compute local validation results, but cannot claim official badge status unless signed by an authorized registry. Badge issuance requires:

1. Domain passes structural validation (`kdna validate`)
2. Domain passes provenance verification (Ed25519 signature)
3. For `tested`: additional quality gate (benchmark or expert review)

This ensures that badge status is a trust signal, not a self-declared label.

## 8. User Control & Non-Automatic Authority

KDNA domains influence judgment. They do NOT grant automatic authority.

The loading priority is:
1. System policy and safety rules (highest)
2. Legal and compliance requirements
3. User's explicit intent
4. KDNA domain judgment
5. Tool/skill instructions
6. General context (lowest)

KDNA MUST NOT override system safety policies, legal requirements, or user's explicit refusal.

## Responsibility Model

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **KDNA Protocol Maintainers** | Maintain format, validation rules, safety baselines, registry policy |
| **KDNA Authors** | Account for Human Locked judgment, applicability boundaries, risk declarations |
| **Studio Integrators** | Must not bypass Human Lock; must not forge provenance |
| **Registry Maintainers** | Review, classify, moderate, yank, and provide risk warnings |
| **Agent/App Developers** | Implement loading strategy, permission controls, user warnings, logging |
| **End Users / Deployers** | Judge applicability in their specific context, especially high-risk scenarios |
