# KDNA Agent Integrations

KDNA integrates with major AI coding agents through a single skill: `kdna-loader`. All KDNA domains live in `~/.kdna/` and are discovered by the agent on demand — they are not registered as separate skills.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Skill Path |
|-------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/kdna-loader/SKILL.md` |
| **Codex** (OpenAI) | `~/.codex/skills/kdna-loader/SKILL.md` |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.agents/skills/kdna-loader/SKILL.md` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/skills/kdna-loader/SKILL.md` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Via `kdna-loader` skill (manual setup) |

## How It Works (the safe-by-default model)

The `kdna-loader` skill is a single instruction file (SKILL.md) that
teaches the agent the **protocol** for using KDNA. It does NOT
pre-load any domains; it does NOT scan all installed domains on every
request.

When you ask the agent a question, the agent decides per-task:

1. **Does this task need KDNA at all?** Most tasks (formatting,
   lookup, code execution) don't. Skip silently.
2. **What's installed?** The agent reads `~/.kdna/domains/` to
   discover available domains. This is filesystem-only — no preloaded
   list.
3. **What fits?** For each candidate domain, the agent reads its small
   `kdna.json` (~1 KB) and checks the v2.1 `applies_when` /
   `does_not_apply_when` fields on the domain's axioms.
4. **Load 0 or 1 primary domain.** If `does_not_apply_when` matches,
   the domain disqualifies itself. If two domains fit and disagree,
   the agent surfaces the choice to the user — never silently blends.
5. **Apply silently.** Once loaded, the agent reasons from the
   domain's axioms, but never quotes KDNA back to the user.

**Why this matters at scale**: a user with 50 installed KDNAs incurs
no context bloat — the agent only reads tiny `kdna.json` files during
discovery and at most loads one full domain's `KDNA_Core.json` +
`KDNA_Patterns.json` per task.

For the full protocol, see [loader-behavior.md](./loader-behavior.md).

## Cross-Agent Compatibility

All agents share the same `~/.kdna/` directory. Install KDNA domains
once, use them everywhere:

```bash
kdna install @aikdna/writing
# Now available in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode.
```

If your agent uses a different default path, create a symlink:

```bash
ln -s ~/.kdna ~/.claude/Kdna
```

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://aikdna.com/install | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
npm install -g @aikdna/kdna
kdna install @aikdna/writing
```

Then install the `kdna-loader` skill for your agent from [kdna-skills](https://github.com/knowledge-dna/kdna-skills).

## What's NOT installed as a skill

- KDNA domains themselves (they live in `~/.kdna/domains/`, discovered
  on demand)
- A domain creator (use `kdna init <name>` CLI when needed)
- Per-project pinning (the v0.7–v0.8 `.kdna/config.json` mechanism was
  removed in v0.9 because it forced loading on tasks the user didn't
  ask for, violating the "install ≠ load" safety model)
