# KDNA Authoring Guide

## Quick Start

1. Copy `templates/minimal-domain/` to your working directory
2. Rename the folder to your domain ID (e.g., `my_domain`)
3. Edit each JSON file — fill in every placeholder in angle brackets
4. Validate: `node validators/kdna-lint.js <your-domain-folder>`
5. Test: `node src/cli.js eval <your-domain-folder>`

## 1. Start Narrow

Do not try to encode an entire profession at once.

**Bad:** `leadership`  
**Better:** `frontline_team_feedback`  
**Best:** `feedback-delivery-first-time-manager`

A narrow domain forces you to write axioms that actually change behavior. A broad domain produces generic advice.

---

## 2. Write the Domain Sentence

Before writing any JSON, answer this:

```text
This domain helps an AI agent judge ______ so that ______.
```

Example:

> This domain helps an AI agent judge whether a meeting produced an actionable decision — or just discussion — so that the agent does not generate action items for commitments that don't exist.

If you cannot fill both blanks concretely, your domain is too vague.

---

## 3. Write Good Axioms

Axioms are the domain's core judgment principles. They must change how the agent responds.

### What makes a good axiom:

- **Specific**: Two experts would agree when it applies
- **Falsifiable**: You can construct a scenario where it does NOT apply
- **Behavior-changing**: The agent would say something different with vs without it

### Good vs Bad:

| Bad (slogan) | Good (operational) |
|---|---|
| "Communication is important." | "The speaker's intent and the listener's interpretation are different things. Judge the gap, not the words." |
| "Be user-centered." | "When a user requests feature X, first identify what outcome they are trying to achieve. Features are means; outcomes are ends." |
| "Trust matters in sales." | "Price objections are certainty deficits, not price problems. Lowering price addresses the symptom; building certainty addresses the cause." |

### Self-test for each axiom:

- If I remove this axiom, would the agent give a different answer to at least one scenario?
- Can I write a specific scenario where this axiom would change the agent's judgment?
- Can I write a scenario where this axiom does NOT apply (proving it has a boundary)?

---

## 4. Write Good Ontology Concepts

Every concept needs a real boundary, not a dictionary definition.

### What makes a good ontology entry:

- **Operational essence**: Not "what does this word mean" but "what does the agent need to check"
- **Real boundary**: Something the agent must NOT confuse this concept with
- **Observable trigger**: Words or patterns the agent can detect in user input

### Good vs Bad:

| Bad (decorative) | Good (operational) |
|---|---|
| Essence: "Trust is important in relationships." Boundary: "Not distrust." | Essence: "The buyer believes you will prioritize their outcome over your commission." Boundary: "Not rapport. Rapport is comfort; trust is confidence in your intent." Trigger: "Buyer asks for references, pauses before answering pricing questions, or says 'I need to think about it' without a specific concern." |
| Essence: "Quality means meeting standards." Boundary: "Not low quality." | Essence: "The product performs its core function without requiring workarounds." Boundary: "Not feature count. A product with 3 features that all work is higher quality than one with 20 features and 15 workarounds." |

---

## 5. Write Good Stances

Stances are the domain's default positions. Think of them as "when in doubt, lean this way."

### What makes a good stance:

- Prescriptive, not descriptive
- An agent would act differently depending on which stance it holds
- Paired with its opposite (so the agent knows both positions exist)

### Good vs Bad:

| Bad (truism) | Good (prescriptive) |
|---|---|
| "Be honest." | "Transparency about uncertainty builds more trust than confident wrong answers." |
| "Listen to the customer." | "The customer describes symptoms; the professional diagnoses causes. Do not build what the customer asks for — build what solves the problem they described." |

---

## 6. Write Good Misunderstandings

Misunderstandings are usually more useful than definitions. For each:

- **wrong**: What an agent without domain cognition would assume
- **correct**: What the domain teaches instead
- **key_distinction**: The specific conceptual boundary
- **why**: What bad judgment results from the wrong interpretation

### Good vs Bad:

| Bad (straw man) | Good (real confusion) |
|---|---|
| Wrong: "Communication doesn't matter." | Wrong: "If the other person is upset, I should address their emotions first." |
| Correct: "Communication matters." | Correct: "If the other person is upset, I should identify the unmet need behind the emotion. Addressing the emotion without the need is temporary relief." |
| **(No real agent would hold this wrong belief)** | **(Many agents default to emotion-first because it feels empathetic)** |

---

## 7. Write Good Self-Checks

Self-checks are yes/no questions the agent asks itself after generating a response. They are the last line of defense.

### What makes a good self-check:

- Yes/no answerable
- Domain-specific (not generic "is this helpful?")
- Would catch a real mistake the agent might make

### Good vs Bad:

| Bad (generic) | Good (domain-specific) |
|---|---|
| "Is the response helpful?" | "Did I check whether the meeting actually produced a decision, or did I just summarize what was discussed?" |
| "Did I follow best practices?" | "Did I identify the buyer's specific certainty deficit before suggesting a response to their price objection?" |
| "Is this clear?" | "Would a domain expert reading this response say 'yes, that's how you think about this' — or did the agent default to common sense?" |

---

## 8. Prefer Observable Signals Over Abstract Labels

A trigger signal should be something the agent can actually detect in text.

**Bad:** `When the user is defensive.`  
**Better:** `When the user repeatedly justifies themselves, quotes the other person as unreasonable, or asks for a sentence that proves they are right.`

## 9. Pre-Publication Checklist

Before submitting a domain, verify:

- [ ] Each axiom changes agent behavior in at least one specific scenario
- [ ] Each ontology concept has a real boundary (something it is NOT)
- [ ] Each stance is prescriptive (would bias the agent toward a different answer)
- [ ] Each misunderstanding describes a belief a real agent might hold
- [ ] Each self-check is a yes/no question specific to this domain
- [ ] All trigger signals are observable in text
- [ ] `kdna-lint` passes with zero warnings
- [ ] `kdna-validate` passes
- [ ] A no-KDNA vs with-KDNA comparison shows a judgment change, not just vocabulary difference
- [ ] The `kdna.json` manifest is filled and accurate

---

## 10. Test Behaviorally

The only valid test: compare two agent responses to the same input — one without KDNA loaded, one with KDNA loaded.

If the difference is only vocabulary (the agent uses different words but reaches the same conclusion), the KDNA is not working. Revise until the judgment itself changes.

```bash
# Test with kdna CLI
node src/cli.js demo

# Run eval on your domain
node src/cli.js eval <your-domain-folder>

# Compare before/after
node benchmarks/eval-decision-state.js --limit=5
```
