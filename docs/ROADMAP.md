# KDNA Roadmap

## Phase 1: Protocol and Runtime Foundation ✅

- ✅ SPEC v1.0-rc — six standard files, JSON Schemas, validation rules
- ✅ `@aikdna/kdna-core` — pure JS runtime library (load, validate, lint, render, compose)
- ✅ `@aikdna/kdna-cli` — CLI toolchain (verify, install, load, match, route, compare, diff, pack, publish, identity, trace)
- ✅ `kdna-registry` — domain catalog with signatures, quality badges, risk levels, CI validation
- ✅ `kdna-skills` — agent loader skill with 7-state routing
- ✅ `kdna-vscode` — VS Code extension (validate, preview, pack)
- ✅ 17 reference domains (10 core + animation cluster)
- ✅ Benchmark infrastructure: 5-model mini benchmark with Best Prompt control, 150 raw outputs
- ✅ Human Judgment Lock: protocol specification + Studio Gate + CLI Gate (4 rules, fingerprint detection)
- ✅ Runtime routing: `kdna route`, 5-Gate 7-State router, route-result schema
- ✅ Governance: TRADEMARK, COMPATIBILITY, FORK_POLICY, GOVERNANCE

## Phase 2: Authoring Infrastructure ✅

- ✅ `@aikdna/kdna-studio` (npm) — JS authoring kernel
- ✅ `kdna-studio-swift` (SPM) — Swift authoring kernel for Apple platforms
- ✅ Judgment Cards (9 types, 6-state machine)
- ✅ Human Lock Gate enforcement (Studio + CLI)
- ✅ Quality Gates (readiness check, contradiction detection, anti-vagueness)
- ✅ Compiler (locked cards → KDNA_Core.json + KDNA_Patterns.json)

## Phase 3: Native App Integration ✅

- ✅ `kdna-core-swift` — native Swift runtime (load, route, compose, trust verify)
- ✅ `kdna-studio-swift` — native Swift authoring kernel
- ✅ KDNAChat — reference GUI client for macOS
- ✅ KDNaStudio — reference authoring client for macOS
- ✅ Agent integrations emerging (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex)

## Phase 4: Trust and Distribution (Current)

- ✅ .kdna open package profile
- ✅ Ed25519 signing pipeline
- ✅ SHA256 hash verification
- ✅ Risk levels (R0–R3)
- ✅ Yanked/deprecated mechanism
- ✅ Registry attestation + CI validation
- ✅ Judgment Guard (Runtime R1–R15)
- ✅ `kdna route` Trust Gate
- ⬜ Official domain signing (pro domains in staging)
- ⬜ Install-time signature verification in CLI

## Phase 5: Encrypted and Licensed KDNA (Next)

- ⬜ Licensed `.kdna` encrypted-entry profile
- ✅ License verification MVP (runtime)
- ✅ KCL-1.0 canonical commercial license
- ⬜ Entitlement model
- ⬜ Organization access control
- ⬜ Offline license lease

## Phase 6: KDNA Store and Judgment System Asset Market (Future)

- ⬜ Creator profiles and verified creators
- ⬜ Package pages with quality evidence
- ⬜ Reviews and certifications
- ⬜ Paid domains and subscriptions
- ⬜ Enterprise private registry
- ⬜ Revenue sharing for multi-creator domains

## Long-Term Vision

KDNA's long-term goal is to become the standard infrastructure for judgment system assets — the layer that turns human-led domain judgment into AI-usable, verifiable, composable, and licensable assets. This is not just a better prompt format or knowledge base. It is a new asset class for the AI era.
